# Wryneck
Wryneck is my first programming language.

The concept is a built in testing system that allowes to check which given values are correct. We call this `pecking` for values - hence the woodpecker theme.

For example if we would like to add one to a number, but forgot which number the number one was:
```Rust
fn add_one(number) {
    let one = ?0..3;
    *)> number + one
}
[
    0 = 1;
    5 = 6;
]
```

As you can see, the tests are simply appended as an "array" to the function.
